### The Product Viewer Application

> The primary page of the Product Viewer application is divided into two
parts. The sidebar on the left displays a list of category links that let the user
select a category. The main portion of the page lists the products for that
category in an HTl'v[L table.when the application starts, this application displays the products in the category named Guitars. Then, if the user wants to view the products in another
category, the user can click on the link for that category.for example, the user
clicks on the Basses link, this application displays the products in that category.
To facilitate that, the category_id field is sent with the HTTP request for the
same page.
