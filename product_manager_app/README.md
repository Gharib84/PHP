### The Product Manager application
> the primary pages of the user interface for the
Product l\tlanager application: the Product List page and the Add Product page

1. The Product List page lets the user view and delete products. It displays a
list of categories and a table of products for the current category. This is similar
to the main page of the Product Viewer application. However, this list includes a
Delete button for each product that lets the user delete the product. In addition,
this page includes an Add Product link below the table that lets the user display
the Add Product page.

2. The Add Product page lets the user add a new product. This page starts by
displaying a drop-down list that lets the user select a category for the product.
Then, it displays three text boxes that lets the user enter data for the product's
code, name, and price. Next, it displays an Add Product button that lets the user
submit the data for the product. Finally, this page displays a View Product List
link that lets the user return to the Product List page without adding a product.
